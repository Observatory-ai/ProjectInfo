In class resume of what group 17 is doing:
- Deeper dive into data analysis
- Meeting with client later today, planning to move our biweekly
meetings to weekly as our project is starting to pick up some pace
- Narrowed down which intersections we will start our study with
	- We have three A very complex, not so complex, a basic one
- Looking for weather data with precipication
- Talked to other industry professionals about acqruing data/talk about lack of data. Reach our to a
professor at UNB, Researchers from Cyro Egypt that worked at UofT, one other economics expert.
- Take an approach of prediction traffic flow in 15 minute intervals use last couple of intervals
- Right now we are looking into creating a very basic traffic flow prediction
- Have someone on the team working on becoming a SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) expert



Meeting with Prof Branco Feb 9th 2022

## Intro:
- Review of our data

## Intersection:
- Removing TTC just means one less thing to predict
- Think about bycicles each 15 minutes in each one of the directions;
 - What we build for bycicles is its own model; predicting cars;
- Problem may be have much data we have to train each one of the models
- Try Contacting city of Toronto if they have more data (maybe even more recent!)
- Prof thinking: if we start with model on past data in intersection, use one week to train next week, how good are we using past 5 days hte next 5 days;
- Used model similar to data streams
- Train and test consider time
- we can use previous window to predict next window observe the accuracy, retrain with that new infor
- train on 15 minutes, prequential evaluation
- use first date to predict next data
- see what we can extrapolate;
- try with one week with the week of next month
- Bigger windows means more data to perfom
- seperation between weeks could be an issue
- but if the best model is using one day to predict next, use that one
- we need to test if wider window is better or smaller window is better
- We need weather and historucal data (precipitation, visiability, temperature (whatever we can collcect, even catagorical values, more specific is better, as much detail as possible))
- bicycle rental data with weather (can predict how many bicycles will be rented using weather ) (just an example)
- Professor in Kanata North (to see he can do or anything interesting)
 
## Soorya Research paper:
- spelling mistakes in research paper = discredited

## For us next week;
- Look into building small model (working on specific time window)
- Finding weather data
- Reach out to city of Toronto
