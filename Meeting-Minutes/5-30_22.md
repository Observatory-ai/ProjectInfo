## Topics

### Hrithik updating on the front end:
* 3 step connecting to api process
	- login
	- gathering data (loading step)
	- available things to import (user can choose what to import)
* Casey Comments:
	- After user finishes 3 steps, app goes back to setttings page confirming configured succesfully and then back to home screen
	-  At a minimum, we almost have MVP, we just need to make it functional
	- Almost has a usesable product

### Making things work
* Loging
	- done in the back end just needs to be plugged into the front end

* Layout what we wnat to have done by the end of August
* A project plan proportional to the time we can dedicate to this
* Be realistic how much time we can dedicate to this
