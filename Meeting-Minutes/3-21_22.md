#March 21st, 2022

### First meeting with Casey
* Introductions of each student

### Review of requiremnets
* Hrithik explaining requirements available on wiki
* Feeback from Casey:
	* Maybe add, brief description of observatory
	* Talk about MVP
	* Its okay to aim higher but really scale MVP down so small so we are 99% we will hit those features
	* Small, ugly and feature deprieved it is... it still brings value
	* Once we are past MVP everything else is gravy
* Mark asking what service would you like to see included:
	* Some of the tools we use that have apis, github, trello, freshbooks, payment evolution and google suite stuff (google calendar)
* Our target audience is general population but we can narrow scope to Casey as our user
	* Casey Feeback: it may make it easier for us to get feedback because he can give us real use cases. For example; number of cards in each colum in trello; Freshbooks the number of hours each team member has worked; Integration with some of these apps may be rough
	* If we get 2 or more services working clearly it would prove the concept. 
	* If we are okay with this it would remove friction
* Mark introducing Passport JS
	* Casey feedback from client perspective: dont care what we use, just pick any two you are giving me benefit (one could work but we want to prove multiservice application)
	* Trello and github
* Hrithik to mark -> How passport work? -> you receive token -> use token for get and post requests
* Back to list of services for first MVP:
	* Github 
	* Google suite (gmail or google calendar (% of time booked in meetings) ) [Google calendar second]
	* Trello
	* Freshbooks (Casey first pick)
		* Not a lot of inforation not easily given but its there 

### Simple UI/UX design feeback 
* Casey feeback:
	* With this project do a super strict MVP (email, password, show freshbooks graph this is the MMVP)
	* For the project we want to finish at the end of the next semester:
		* Is it we choose graphs for the user or can you really create own graphs? (in terms of middle MVP)
			* Hrithik response we hope users create the chart
			* Once we know service and whats available we can setup default graphs (cookie cutter graphs)
		* Casey envision onboarding preview ( click here to change y axis) (now try changing x axis)
		* be very strict on types of graphs we can build for MVP
		* OBuild our app from front to back (only certain graph, only certain data, only certain colour then slowly add more)
	* End of this course login link freshbooks and build my first graph
	* Have specific integration points but the layer above those points needs to be generic (data from freshbooks massage it into a generic datasets)
	* Our front end graph should know as little as possible from that application 
	* Our grpah will just take is date numbers and values
	* Generic and scalable
* Casey: should we set a goal of a graph to create?; Lets start really simple; select fresbooks I want to see total amount of time logged for the entire team (x axis is day, y axis is number of hours logged)
	* If we get to that we will get more
* Casey google calendar: (x axis march 7th to march 14th, y axis number of hours scheudle in meetings)
* Pre

## Goal for presentation in 3 weeks
* Login
* connect to api
* pre created graph
* Casey: idc about anything else I just want to see graph, (cut out everything and get to the value)

## Goal before next meeting:
* Have it essentially done

### Backend with Mark
