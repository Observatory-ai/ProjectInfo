Meeting with Prof Branco, March 1st 2022


# Main Topics:

## Review:
* Small review of what was discussed yesterday (City of Toronto)

## Soorya Approach of using some error to compare effcacity of RiverFlow model:
* This is not main goal
* Good compairison metric



## Hrithik discussion about River:
* Prediciting bicycles going East 
* Standard Scaling; some gaps in knowledge
* Question: Lets say we train and predict (accuracy of 90% for example): How do we put that back in training?
River should take care of this for us, pretention? is option in River to do this, will print plot and take care of this
the idea of this is you have model trainined on 100 instances you predict 101. Train and predict next value; how do we account for inaccuracy?
we don't look at it too much, we care more about how the model is behaving more over time. Maybe look into multiflow, we want to see evoluation of metrics
* mean squared error is better metric,
* mean abs error gives exact difference
* focus on real values
* Suggestion to avoid leakage (you can compose a pipeline)


## Greg
* Optmizie things a bit
* We want to past decisions 
* Look into compute canada tutorial (1 hour, guide us through how to run our jobs)
* Compute canada 

## Things Prof Branco has planned:
* Check with professor Bourac when we could visit adn what information could be useful for us to visit.
* Talk about to do virtual tour

## On our end:
* Mark: Sumo simulation
* Hrithik continue to work on sliding windo prediction
* Greg, look more into DeepQLearning,
