First new meeting for Observatory


# Topics


## Finding client
* Hrithik talking to Casey 
* Confirm with Prof Branco
* Meeting with professor Branco tomorrow

## Prioritization of things
* Meeting with TA and/or professor but after meeting with Client
 * Confirm what needs to be done
* Avoid grade being affected
* Writing requirements for application
* UI prototypes
* CI/CD
* Delegate tasks after tomorrow


## Project wise
* React Front-End
* Node JS backend
* Final demo, showcase front-end 

## Meeting with Prof Branco
* Push back 
* Given we are far into semester and the fact we have not had a ton of progress in comparison to other groups taking the course... After hearing professor lethbridge speak in our lecture last friday, may not be the best idea in from an academic standpoint. We do have memebers with much better web development experience
