Meeting with Lethbridge Jan 21st

## How to conform with requirements?

Don't worry about that, just make sure you have progress to show 

## Final product for ML project?

* We will not be able to install this physically, our case is Proof of case experiment
* Outcome: simulation environment 
* Another idea: Use Machine learning to make time adjustments
* SUMO simulation: use toronto dataset volume
* start with one intersection
* IDEA: USE SIMULATION using real data
