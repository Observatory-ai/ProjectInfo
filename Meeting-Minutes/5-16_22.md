Meeting May 16th, With Casey


## Topics

### Where we left off:
- Team's presentation for final was good. (Good job explaining our lessons learned in switching a project)

### What's been going on:
- Hrithik working on creating graphs
- Mark integrating front and back end
- Greg -> Tests for Mark

### What are our priorities
* Integration is important
* Best for Casey is to get something up on server that he can interact with that shows off the bare bones of the project
* A way to interact with the app (Maybe not even interacting with the backend) to get feedback (dont go too far with this)
* Any key pieces (Make that MVP) all pieces that touch everything rather than one single detailed peice
* Just get bare bones done even if its not a lot of detail (prove all pieces work as early as possible)
* Then it becomes intergrating on those pieces


### Hrithik -> Back and front end integration
*  Creating a standard service class with a set template ? (Is that essential component)
	* Not necessarily -> proof of concept is more important -> Whats more important is that we keep this in mind when integrating
	* The need may not be there until down the road (Its possible down the road people only use very few APIs)
	* Its a good idea and good software design principal
	* If its easy to do from the start go for it. 
	* If its difficult and slowing us down we may want to consider just putting it on the backburner
	* We need something to interact with. Like if we spend all this time on something and no one uses it ... waste of time
* Get Mark to teaching us what he has done
	* We want to spread the work evenly 
	* Encourage mark to assign us really small backend tasks
	* Peer programming session with him (he watches we code) forces us to learn and mark to delegate
	* Very hard skill to develop is delegation

### Editing and creating chart page
* End user is not technical (maybe even start ups or small companies who maybe don't have analyst who)
* Creating charts and playing with data or have it presented to you?
	* Depends on what those graphs are - Casey
	* Day to day usage of product would be reading it - Casey
	* If we get exactly what he wants he has no need to edit and change. But that is a huge IF and one person
	* So the likelyhood we get what everyone wants is slim -> Editing and creating is important
	* Give user a starting point rather than get them to start from scratch
	* Give for example 5 graphs to start with and are all editable
	* UX will be more successful if we have pre created graphs
	* Once everythiung is setup though, creating/editing graphs will not be an everyday thing 
	* Any backend and front end components touch all major pieces of our project
	* We work on the components themselves once everything is working and good


#### Get chart working dynamically - Everything we think we can strip out ... do it. Everything can even work by manually typing it in

* 1 chart (x and y axis and generates chart, get that working for every part.
* Working front end/ back end, log in, saving the chart,
* Big thing Casey has learned, every little thing we want to add... takes time  
* From project management perspective minimal is best but don't let that stiple creativitry


### Database structure
* How are we going to store data based on where graphs positioned 
* But form MVP maybe just have a stack with position 1, 2, 3 to 5 (example)
* Take a look at some libraries that have customizable grids (everything is serialized into one object)
* Have a masive json object in database
* We are getting into sofistacated design, but every graph has very different design
* We will most likely have a very unstructured database with one big data column (not traditional database design)
* we develop our own storage protocol and just follow it.
* Maybe just store json file and read it in databse.
* Just look for packages

### Logging service is quite important
* We need to be able to logging to these third pparty APIs for this to work
* The easiest way to map out is to answer ... what is our minimumn user journey?
	* I need a page for the person to land on
	* I need a page to login (no signup needed)
	* Connect to a service (for example only google)
	* then create a graph (create graphs for the user)
